# Social

A simple social media sketch written in Django and Vue.
This project is a vessel for trying out new ideas or solidifying existing practices. Sepecifically:

* Roll-you-own data later: using a repository design mattern to use raw sql queries to gather data, rather than relying on Django's build in ORM
* DIY API: Django Rest Framework is cool, but I always end up having to reconfigure, or stip-out much of the functionality that it ships with when installed in a project
* Front end redux store and routing with Vue (practice makes perfect!)
